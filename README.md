# Gatling

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hashrocket/gatling.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hashrocket/gatling) [![Hex Version](https://img.shields.io/hexpm/v/gatling.svg)](https://hex.pm/packages/gatling)

Conveniently deploy a bunch of Phoenix apps

The main goal of Gatling is to make it very easy, cheap, and convenient to deploy Phoenix apps.

Gatling is essentially a collection of mix tasks that (from a Git push) automatically create an Distillery release and launches/upgrades it on your server.

## NOTE:
As of Gatling v1.0.0, [Distillery](https://github.com/bitwalker/distillery), is the assumed release building tool as opposed to Exrm.
If up are upgrading form a previous verison of Gatling, simply change the `exrm` dependency to `distillery` in your `mix.exs` file and you should be good to go.

## Gatling, Distillery and Nginx
As you read through the instructions, keep in mind that both Distillery and Nginx have tons of options you can configure outside of Gatling. Gatling's goal is is to offer an out-of-the-box solution that keeps out of the way of your custom deployment stategy. For example, Distillery requires a configuration file in `./rel/config.exs` of your project. There is a [lot](https://hexdocs.pm/distillery/configuration.html) you can do with this but if you decide not to install this yourself, Gatling will generate a basic one for you.

Please see the [Distillery](https://hexdocs.pm/distillery/getting-started.html) docs to unlock the full power of your releases while Gatling simply triggers them in a convenient way.

## Instructions

### Setting up the server
This has been tested on an Ubuntu 16.04 x64 server on Ec2 and Digital Ocean.

Install elixir, nginx, and the Gatling archive on your server

```bash
$ ssh server.address
```
Follow instructions [here](http://elixir-lang.org/install.html#unix-and-unix-like) to install elixir
```bash
$ sudo apt-get install nginx git
$ mix archive.install https://github.com/hashrocket/gatling_archives/raw/master/gatling.ez
```

###  Deploying your app

For a brand new project:

SSH into your server and run the following:

```bash
$ mix gatling.load {mix project name}
```
Ensure your elixir project can build a production release with [Distillery](https://github.com/bitwalker/distillery)

Add a file to the root of your project named `domains` and  list  all  domains that will point to this project. See an example [here](https://github.com/hashrocket/gatling/tree/master/test/sample_project)

In your `config/prod.exs` make sure your `port` configuration uses an environment variable called `PORT` (Gatling will set this for you automatically):

 ```elixir
config :my_app, MyApp.Endpoint, [
  http: [port: {:system, "PORT"}],
]
 ```

Setup your git remote and push to your server:

```elixir
$ git remote add production user_with_root_access@<address.to.server>:<project_name>
$ git push production master
```

SSH back into your server and ensure you have your `secret.exs` file(s) installed if needed

Set your environment to `prod` by adding the following to `/etc/environment`
```bash
MIX_ENV=prod
```

For the initial deploy. Run `$ mix gatling.deploy {project_name}` and Gatling will do the following.
- Create a `distillery` release and put all the parts in the right place
- Find an open port, configure nginx to proxy to your app
- Create an `init.d` file so your app will boot if/when your server restarts

### Performing hot upgrades to your running application

Once your app is running do the following:

- Increase the version number of your application. See [here](https://github.com/hashrocket/gatling/blob/master/mix.example.exs) for an example to automatically increase the version number along with your commit.
- Commit your new changes
- `git push path.to.remote:project`

And that's it! You'll see the new version being deployed with no downtime!.
Thats it!!! You are golden.

##Callbacks

### Gatling.Tasks.Deploy

In your project root, create a file called `deploy.ex`. Define any of the following functions to to wrap the Gatling deployment actions:

```elixir
defmodule SampleProject.DeployCallbacks do

  def before_mix_deps_get(env)
  def after_mix_deps_get(env)

  def before_mix_compile(env)
  def after_mix_compile(env)

  def before_mix_digest(env)
  def after_mix_digest(env)

  def before_mix_release_init(env)
  def after_mix_release_init(env)

  def before_mix_release(env)
  def after_mix_release(env)

  def before_make_deploy_dir(env)
  def after_make_deploy_dir(env)

  def before_copy_release_to_deploy(env)
  def after_copy_release_to_deploy(env)

  def before_expand_release(env)
  def after_expand_release(env)

  def before_install_init_script(env)
  def after_install_init_script(env)

  def before_mix_ecto_setup(env)
  def after_mix_ecto_setup(env)

  def before_start_service(env)
  def after_start_service(env)

  def before_configure_nginx(env)
  def after_configure_nginx(env)

end

```

__Note:__ the `env` is passed to every function. It is a READ only struct you can use. Returning `env` from a callback function will have no effect on the rest of the deployment process. [Here](/env.example.exs) is an example of the `env` that is passed in.

### Gatling.Tasks.Upgrade

In your project root, create a file called `upgrade.ex`. Define any of the following functions to to wrap the Gatling upgrade actions:

```elixir
defmodule SampleProject.UpgradeCallbacks do

  def before_mix_deps_get(env)
  def after_mix_deps_get(env)

  def before_mix_compile(env)
  def after_mix_compile(env)

  def before_mix_digest(env)
  def after_mix_digest(env)

  def before_mix_release_init(env)
  def after_mix_release_init(env)

  def before_mix_release(env)
  def after_mix_release(env)

  def before_make_upgrade_dir(env)
  def after_make_upgrade_dir(env)

  def before_copy_release_to_upgrade(env)
  def after_copy_release_to_upgrade(env)

  def before_upgrade_service(env)
  def after_upgrade_service(env)

end
```

__Note:__ the `env` is passed to every function. It is a READ only struct you can use. Returning `env` from a callback function will have no effect on the rest of the upgrade process. [Here](https://github.com/hashrocket/gatling/blob/master/env.example.exs) is an example of the `env` that is passed in.

#### System Commands in your callbacks.

While implementing your callback funtions. If you are going to use `System.cmd/3`, use `bash/3` instead to get a prettier and more transparent output

#### Example
Say I want to install wget before my dependencies are installed in the `deploy` task.
I would create a file in my project called `./deploy.ex` with the following:

```elixir
defmodule SampleProject.DeployCallbacks do

  def before_mix_deps_get(_env) do
    bash("sudo", ~w[apt-get install wget]
  end

end
```

And that's it. That function will be called right before `mix deps get`

## Development

```
$ git clone https://github.com/hashrocket/gatling.git
$ cd gatling
$ mix deps.get
#Clone the archives repo
$ git clone https://github.com/hashrocket/gatling_archives.git
```

## Releases

To create a new release, take the following steps:

1. Bump your verson number in `mix.exs`
2. `git add . && git commit -m 'bump to v<version>'
3. `$ MIX_ENV=prod mix build`
4. `$ cd gatling_archives`
5. `$ git add .`
6. `$ git commit -m "release v<version>"`
7. `$ git push origin master`
8. `$ cd ../ && git tag v<version>`
9. `$ git push origin <tag>`
